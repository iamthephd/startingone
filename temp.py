1) Problem Statement

Users waste significant time manually searching through long videos to locate specific content, with no efficient way to navigate directly to relevant moments.
Current video platforms offer limited search functionality that typically only identifies videos, not specific timestamps or moments within videos.
This inefficiency creates a productivity barrier for researchers, students, professionals, and content consumers who need to extract specific information from video content.

2) Solution Approach

Develop a pipeline that transcribes videos, indexes content with timestamps, and employs a multi-LLM architecture to process natural language queries and return precise video segments.
Implement a refinement system where the first LLM identifies potential timestamp matches, and subsequent LLMs filter and rank results for relevance and accuracy.
Create an intuitive interface that allows users to input queries, view results with timestamps, and jump directly to relevant video segments.

3) Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit for rapid development of an interactive demo interface
Core Processing: LangChain and LangGraph for orchestrating the multi-LLM workflow and managing the processing pipeline
Model Integration: Google's Gemini for primary LLM functions, YouTube Transcript API for initial content extraction, OpenAI's Whisper for non-YouTube video transcription
Data Management: Vector database (e.g., Chroma or Pinecone) for efficient semantic searching of video transcript segments

4) Market Positioning (ROI)

Target market includes educational institutions, corporate training departments, research organizations, and content creators who need efficient video content navigation.
Time savings translate directly to productivity gains—reducing search time from minutes to seconds creates measurable ROI for organizations with large video repositories.
Potential for integration with enterprise video platforms or as a value-added service for content hosting platforms creates monetization opportunities.

5) Feasibility & Completeness

Core functionality is achievable within hackathon timeframe using existing APIs and open-source tools, with no need for custom model training.
The modular approach allows for incremental development—starting with YouTube videos provides a contained scope while leaving room for expansion.
Technical components (transcription, LLM processing, UI development) are mature enough to support reliable implementation.

6) Risks/Assumptions

Accuracy depends on transcription quality, which may vary with audio clarity, accents, technical terminology, and background noise.
Processing long videos may create latency issues or higher computational costs that could affect scalability.
Multi-LLM approach increases complexity and potential points of failure, requiring careful orchestration and fallback mechanisms.
